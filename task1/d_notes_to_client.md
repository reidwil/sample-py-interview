# Notes to Client
`select * from brooklyndata.client_schema.daily_order_stats;`

---------

The table is quite straightforward in the calculations. If anything seems off I can help debug. Furthermore, if we don't think data looks right, I am happy to help hop on a call and look at the underlying table's data to make sure everything is accurate.

> One thing to note: I am working off the assumption that the way your company calculates order revenue is by multiplying the price of each order by the amount of payments due for the order. If this is inaccurate, please let me know (reid@email.com) and I will get it adjusted to the right calculation.


### Quick facts:

- Each metric is defined in [the metric definitions](b_metric_definitions.md)
- The first order was placed on: `2016-09-04`
- Bath and Health products seem to contribute the most to revenue
- Thanksgiving is a big revenue time for the company (especially in 2017)!
